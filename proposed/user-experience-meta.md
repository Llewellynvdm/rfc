# User Experience Meta Document
_Pre-Draft_

## 1. Summary

> User experience (UX or UE) is a person's emotions and attitudes about using a particular product, system or service. It
includes the practical, experiential, affective, meaningful, and valuable aspects of humanâ€“computer interaction and
product ownership. Additionally, it includes a person's perceptions of system aspects such as utility, ease of use, and
efficiency. User experience may be subjective in nature to the degree that it is about individual perception and thought
with respect to a product or system. User experience varies dynamically, constantly modifying over time due to changing
usage circumstances. Simplified, user experience is about how a user interacts with, and experiences, a product.

Standards are not something that inspires, not even UX standards. And yet they can be very useful for two reasons:

* They provide a compact overview.
* They help to convince.

Both tasks are now better fulfilled by one of the most important standards for UX: **DIN EN ISO 9241-110** was updated
in October 2020. The most important change, for those who already know it: Individualisation has finally been
moved to the back in the right place. There is also a new interaction principle, user engagement.

This specification aims to provide people involved in UX decisions with a common set of principles and vocabulary.

## 2. Why Bother?

While developers have SOLID (five design principles intended to make software designs more understandable, flexible, and
maintainable), GRASP (guidelines for assigning responsibility to classes and objects in object-oriented design)  and
others to guide them in their work, the UX area seems to get lost in details about size, position and colour of buttons
due to lack of corresponding sign-poles.

This set of interaction principles, defined by an international standard, will help people in the UX area to make and 
test design decisions against universal high level requirements and thus continuously improve Joomla's user experience.

## 3. Scope

### 3.1 Goals

The goal of this RfC is to 
* provide guidance to improve UX for Joomla
* provide a reference for discussions (e.g., _"This violates the Task Adequacy, because ..."_, _"In order to increase
  Self-Descriptiveness, we could ..."_)

### 3.2 Non-Goals

This RfC will not define specific workflows or designs for the CMS or other Joomla projects.

## 4. Approach

### 4.1 DIN EN ISO 9241-110 - Ergonomics of human-system interaction - Part 110: Interaction principles

This updated standard is part of the DIN EN ISO 9241 series of standards, which defines, among other things, how
keyboards, monitors and displays and the working environment should look. It also specifies which properties
applications, software and websites should have. The **seven interaction principles** are an important basis for all this.
These used to be called "principles of dialogue design". These are the characteristics that all good applications should
have (the standard speaks of "interactive systems").
These seven principles of interaction are:

#### 1. Task Adequacy:

The system supports the user in performing their tasks. The focus is on these tasks rather than on the technical
requirements/processes of the system.

#### 2. Self-Descriptiveness:

The system can be used as much as possible without the user being instructed or having to look up anything.

#### 3. Conformity to Expectations:

The system works for the user in the same way as they knows it from other applications.

#### 4. Learnability:

The system supports the user to learn how to use it independently.

#### 5. Controllability:

The user has the system under control at all times and can adapt it to their own preferences and needs.

#### 6. Robustness against User Errors:

The system helps to avoid errors, tolerates them and helps to correct them if they occur nevertheless.

#### 7. User Engagement:

The system presents functions and information in an inviting and motivating way. This promotes the user's ongoing
interaction with the system.
